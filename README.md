# library-project

The goal of this project was to build a small library app where we can add books with title, author, number of pages, set whether the book was read or not and we have a delete button on each book to remove it from the library.

I spent 11 days on this project. Out of those 11 days I was stuck on one sub-problem for 3 days, on another sub-problem for 2 days and another sub-problem for 2 days, so I spent 7/11 days on 3 sub-problems. I feel that that time wasn't wasted because it forced me to analyze the program flow closely and understand what is going on at each step.

Also, the 2 problems I was stuck on I managed to solve early in the morning after a good night's rest, that's telling me that sometimes pushing yourself has diminishing returns (I was working on the project 12 hours/day).

I styled everything and built almost everything with Javascript, I wanted to try it because I never did that before.

I tried to be more organized with my code and to break stuff up into individual functions to make things more modular and easier to read.

Some of the things I learned:

- How constructor functions and prototype inheritance works
- How to use the dialog element
- Checkbox state and checkbox value are different things. I didn't know the difference (I presumed they are the same) and that caused me quite a few problems
- Rest (diffuse mode) is important

Mistakes I've made/things to improve:

- Not looking at the big picture, making assumptions about the code instead of really looking what is going on

Things to fix:

- If I add books manually to myLibrary array, book card checkbox that changes the read/not read state doesn't work
